    <abstract>
      <para>This document describes all possible mechanisms for JSP pages to
      include other pages. These mechanisms (of which 3 are MMBase specific)
      can be used to build modular sites.

  <section>
    <title>Introduction</title>
    <para>
      Since the release of MMBase 1.5 there are two tags within the MMBase
      taglib which are introduced in this document: 
      <computeroutput>&lt;mm:treeinclude&gt;</computeroutput> and
      <computeroutput>&lt;mm:leafinclude&gt;</computeroutput>. These tags
      allow a site to be set up in a very modular way; this documentation
      is meant to aid templaters to use these tags efficiently.
    </para>
    <para>
      In the next sections we will first describe the existing include
      mechanisms, and later on elaborate on the specifics of the two
      newly introduced tags.
    </para>
  </section>
  <section>
    <title>JSP Include Directive</title>
    <para>
      With a JSP Include Directive, one can directly insert the content
      of another JSP as if it was part of the calling JSP. The servlet
      engine will combine these JSPs before compilation; one big 
      JSP file is the result. The following syntax is used for this
      directive:
<programlisting><![CDATA[<%@ include file="includes/header.jsp" %>]]></programlisting>
      If a page 'A' does an include of page 'B', this means that all
      information defined in page 'A' (most importantly: methods and variables)
      are available in page 'B'. This means that all methods and
      variables need to have unique names, otherwise conflicts will occur.
    </para>
    <note>
      <para>
        You can (and must if using JSPX) also use the following syntax:
        <programlisting><![CDATA[<jsp:directive.include file="includes/header.jsp" />]]></programlisting>
      </para>
    </note>
    <para>
      The main benefit of using this directive is speed: inclusion is
      done at compile-time and it has no cost on execution time. The disadvantage
      is that the name of the page to be included needs to be known at
      compile-time; dynamic inclusion of pages is not possible.
    </para>
  </section>
  <section>
    <title>JSP Include Action</title>
    <para>
      Another way of inclusion of another JSP page is by using the JSP Include
      Action. The difference with the Include Directive is that not the source
      of the JSP, but it's output is included. The include JSP page is being
      executed within the servlet engine and it's output is returned to the
      calling page. The following syntax is used:
<programlisting><![CDATA[<jsp:include page="includes/page.jsp?param1=value">
   <jsp:param name="param2" value="value2" />
</jsp:include>]]></programlisting>
      The example shows that there are two ways of passing named variables: 
      either pass them on directly in the URL, or add them using 
      <computeroutput>&lt;jsp:param&gt;</computeroutput> tags.
    </para>
    <para>
      The main benefit of using the Include Action is that the URL to include
      can be constructed during execution of the page; and that double variable
      names in pages are no problem. However, every included page results in a
      new request to the servlet engine, which means there is a bit of a 
      performance impact when compared to the include directive.
    </para>
    <note>
      <para>
        Actually not a complete new request is done. The same request is reused. The performance
        overhead is probably neclectible.
      </para>
    </note>
  </section>
  <section>
    <title>MMBase Include</title>
    <para>
      The MMBase Include has great resemblance with the JSP Include Action,
      parameter names and subtags have the same names:
<programlisting><![CDATA[<mm:include page="includes/page.jsp?param1=value">
  <mm:param name="param2" value="value2" />
</mm:include>]]></programlisting>
      The advantage of using the MMBase Include instead of the JSP Include
      Action is that contextvariables can be used. By using
      the <computeroutput>referids</computeroutput> parameter you can
      easily pass on any variables that were given to this page. For example,
      in the <computeroutput>includes/page.jsp</computeroutput> file one
      could use the following code snippet:
<programlisting><![CDATA[<mm:include page="subinclude.jsp" referids="param1,param2" />]]></programlisting>
    </para>
  </section>
  <section>
    <title>MMBase TreeInclude</title>
    <para>
      TreeInclude is an extension to the MMBase Include, which chooses a
      page from a list of possible pages; and then includes the one 
      best suited. The general idea is that TreeInclude receives a path
      of objects that are used to find a file on disk that fits the given
      objects most closely.
    </para>
    <section>
      <title>SmartPath</title>
      <para>
        The functionality that finds a template for a given list of
        objects is called smartpath. Smartpath is a function on a node, 
        which returns the best possible path for that node. The standard
        behavior of Smartpath is to return a path that exists of the
        node numbers, possibly postfixed by a random string. So, if
        <computeroutput>getSmartPath()</computeroutput> is called on 
        node number 138, in a directory where one of the subdirectories
        is <computeroutput>138something</computeroutput>, <computeroutput>getSmartPath()</computeroutput>
        will return this path. If there is no matching path, a <computeroutput>null</computeroutput>
        value is returned.
      </para>
      <para>
        The default behavior described here can be overridden by a
        developer by creating a new builder class for a nodemanager.
        For all following examples, we assume that such a special class
        has been written, that uses the value of the <computeroutput>title</computeroutput>
        field of the node as the path to return.
      </para>
      <para>
        NOTE: when <computeroutput>getSmartPath()</computeroutput> is called,
        it always operates by default from the <computeroutput>HTML root</computeroutput>
        of the servlet context. That means that TreeInclude does NOT include files from the
        current working directory.
      </para>
    </section>
    <section>
      <title>TreeInclude workings</title>
      <para>
        When doing a TreeInclude, you need to specify a list of objects. These are then
        used to create a list of possible pages to include. First, <computeroutput>getSmartPath()</computeroutput>
        is called on the first object. Then, it is called on the second object from the directory that
        was just found; this procedure continues until all objects are used,
        or until one of the <computeroutput>getSmartPath()</computeroutput>s returns
        a <computeroutput>null</computeroutput> value. The following example will make this
        a bit more clear:
<programlisting><![CDATA[<mm:treeinclude page="includes/page.jsp?param1=value" objectlist="100,140,321">
  <mm:param name="param2" value="value2" />
</mm:include>]]></programlisting>
        The three objects mentioned in the <computeroutput>objectlist</computeroutput>
        parameter have the following properties:
        <itemizedlist>
          <listitem>
            <para>100; this is an object of type <computeroutput>portals</computeroutput> with
             title 'mmbase'</para>
          </listitem>
          <listitem>
            <para>140; this is an object of type <computeroutput>events</computeroutput> with
             title 'mmevent3'</para>
          </listitem>
          <listitem>
            <para>321; this is an object of type <computeroutput>news</computeroutput> with 
            title 'introduction'</para>
          </listitem>
        </itemizedlist>
        TreeInclude will now call the <computeroutput>getSmartPath()</computeroutput> method
        on all objects; it stops as soon as a <computeroutput>null</computeroutput> value
        is returned. All possible pages that could be included are:
        <itemizedlist>
          <listitem>
            <para>/mmbase/mmevent3/introduction/includes/page.jsp</para>
          </listitem>
          <listitem>
            <para>/mmbase/mmevent3/includes/page.jsp</para>
          </listitem>
          <listitem>
            <para>/mmbase/includes/page.jsp</para>
          </listitem>
          <listitem>
            <para>/includes/page.jsp</para>
          </listitem>
        </itemizedlist>
        The most specific one of these shall be included; this means this list
        is being evaluated from top to bottom; the first file that exists will
        be included.
      </para>
    </section>
  </section>
  <section>
    <title>MMBase LeafInclude</title>
    <para>
      The LeafInclude and TreeInclude tags bear great similarities: they both
      use <computeroutput>getSmartPath()</computeroutput> on the objects passed
      in the <computeroutput>objectlist</computeroutput> parameter in order
      to find a page to include. The difference is that when TreeInclude discards
      objects that return a <computeroutput>null</computeroutput> value, while
      the LeafInclude continues with substituting this <computeroutput>null</computeroutput>
      value with the builder name of the object. An example will shed some light
      on this:
<programlisting><![CDATA[<mm:leafinclude page="includes/page.jsp?param1=value" objectlist="100,140,321">
  <mm:param name="param2" value="value2" />
</mm:include>]]></programlisting>
      The three objects mentioned in the <computeroutput>objectlist</computeroutput>
      parameter have the following properties:
      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para>100; this is an object of type <computeroutput>portals</computeroutput> with
           title 'mmbase'</para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <para>140; this is an object of type <computeroutput>events</computeroutput> with
           title 'mmevent3'</para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <para>321; this is an object of type <computeroutput>news</computeroutput> with 
          title 'introduction'</para>
        </listitem>
      </itemizedlist>
      LeafInclude will now call the <computeroutput>getSmartPath()</computeroutput> method
      on all objects; if this yields a <computeroutput>null</computeroutput> value, the
      name of the builder will be used. The following list of possible pages is compiled:
      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para>/mmbase/mmevent3/introduction/includes/page.jsp</para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <para>/mmbase/mmevent3/news/includes/page.jsp</para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <para>/mmbase/events/news/includes/page.jsp</para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <para>/portals/events/news/includes/page.jsp</para>
        </listitem>
      </itemizedlist>
      The most specific one of these shall be included; this means this list
      is being evaluated from top to bottom; the first file that exists will
      be included.
    </para>
  </section>
  <section>
    <title>Tag files</title>
    <para>
      In newer servlet containers, also the possibilities to use tag-files exists. These are very
      similar to dynamic includes like jsp:include and mm:include but provide a nicer syntax, and
      better way of packaging for general reuse (they can be included in jars).
    </para>
    <para>
      An example of a custom image-tag. A file WEB-INF/tags/my/image.tagx was placed, containing this:
    <programlisting><![CDATA[
<jsp:root
 version="1.2"
 xmlns:jsp="http://java.sun.com/JSP/Page"
 xmlns:mm="http://www.mmbase.org/mmbase-taglib-2.0">
  <jsp:directive.attribute name="template"   />
  <mm:node>
    <mm:image template="s(800x800&gt;)+f(png)">
      <a
       title="${_node.title}"
       href="${_}" onclick="window.open(this.href, '${mm:escape('identifier', _node.title)}', 'width=${dimension.width + 20},height=${dimension.height + 20}'); return false;">
        <mm:image template="$template" mode="img" />
      </a>
    </mm:image>
  </mm:node>
</jsp:root>
]]></programlisting>
    </para>
    <para>
      Now it can be used as follows (in a JSPX):
    <programlisting><![CDATA[
<sometag xmlns:vl="urn:jsptagdir:/WEB-INF/tags/my">
  ...
  <mm:listnodes type="images" max="5">
    <my:image template="s(x200)" />
  </mm:listnodes>
  ....
]]></programlisting>
    
     Which creates (maximal) 5 images in the HTML which are clickable, and produce a pop-up window
     with a bigger version of the same image if you click on them.
    </para>
  </section>
  <section>
    <title>Dynamic includes and the REQUEST scope</title>
    <para>
      When using dynamic includes (like tag-files, mm:include or mm:leafinclude), you may want to
      use the REQUEST scope to pass stuff around to this included page.
    </para>
    <para>
      MMBase variables can be explicitely written to the request scope:
      <programlisting><![CDATA[
<mm:write referid="foo" request="bar" />
]]></programlisting>
    </para>
    <para>
      And also be explictely picked up:
      <programlisting><![CDATA[
<mm:import from="request" externid="bar" />
]]></programlisting>
      Though that is not even necessary, because EL also expresses variables on the request.
    </para>
    <section>
      <title>Implicit REQUEST scope variables</title>
      <para>
        Since MMBase-1.8.1 several implicit variables are on default scoped in the request, which
        makes dynamic include even easier to use. These are:
      </para>
      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para>
            The locale settings of mm:locale and mm:content. Effectively included pages have the
            same locale a the including page, which makes much sense.
          </para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <para>
            The escaper parameter of the mm:content tag. No need to use a mm:content on all included
            pages.
          </para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <para>
            The _node implicit 'current' node variable. This is also picked up by a mm:node tag with
            no parents. The effect is that you can easily refer to the 'current' node in a include
            page, simply by surrounding an empty mm:node. The tag-file example makes use of this.
          </para>
        </listitem>
      </itemizedlist>
