<h1>Variables</h1>
Please have the code of this page handy.
<h2>Simple pure taglib</h2>
<p>
In a limited way you can use `variables' without escaping to
jsp-coding. A variable you can define with the `import' tag. Lets
define a variable with name `a' and value `aaaa'.
</p>
<mm:import id="a">aaaa</mm:import>
<p>
And print it out.  a: <mm:write referid="a" />
</p>
<p>
Of course it is easy to make a new variable in which the value of the
variable `a' is used. Lets put some b's around it, and put it in `b'.
</p>
<mm:import id="b">bbb<mm:write referid="a" />bbb</mm:import>
<p>
The variable b is now: <mm:write referid="b" />
</p>
<p>
Another common thing to want is to change the value of a
variable. This can only be done by first destroying the variable, and
then recreating it. Lets set the variable 'a' to 'aaab'.
<!-- should this not be more handy ??
  I'd like an attribute in import for this.
  This would also permit to more easily _change_ the value of a variable.
-->
</p>
<mm:remove referid="a" /><mm:import id="a">aaab</mm:import>
<p>
And print it out again. a: <mm:write referid="a" />
</p>
<p>
To write the value of a variable to the page, we did use the `write'
tag. If the value of the variable must be used in some attribute than
you have to use the ${}-notation. For example like this: <mm:url
page="${a}" />
</p>
<h2>Escaping to JSP</h2>
<p>
 If you want to use more complicated things than this with variables,
 then you need to convert your variable to a jsp-variable, which you
 can treat with all means of Java. This can be done immediately with
 the import tag (if you really often need the variable in JSP), but
 also later, with the `write' tag (The variable then is available only
 in the body of the write tag). We create a new variable 'A' wich is
 'a' but uppercased with a java function.
</p>
<mm:write jspvar="a" referid="a" vartype="String">
 <mm:import id="A"><%= a.toUpperCase() %></mm:import>
</mm:write>
<p>
 The value of A: <mm:write referid="A" />
</p>
<p>
 Jsp-variable also have a type. Currently they can be `Object',
 `String', `Node' or `Integer'. This can lead to exceptions (error
 messages). You can for example not use our variable `a' as a Node,
 since it is not a node, but a String.
</p>
<p>
 Lets put a node in variable `typedefnode'.
</p>
<mm:cloud>
<mm:listnodes type="typedef" max="1" ><mm:node id="typedefnode" /></mm:listnodes>
<p>
 Writing this variable is possible (though not very usefull). typedef: <mm:write referid="typedefnode" />  
</p>
<p>
 Lets make a jsp-variable of this node, and write a field of it:
<mm:write jspvar="td" referid="typedefnode" vartype="Node">
 <%= td.getValue("description") %>
</mm:write>
</p>
<p>
 This was of course a lousy example, because for simply writing a field
 you don't need jsp at all:
<mm:node referid="typedefnode"><mm:field name="description" /></mm:node>
</p>
<h1>Tags and id's</h1>
<h2>Referring to other tags than the direct parent</h2>
<p>
  We have already seen how to use the 'id' attribute of the 'import'
  tag and of the 'node' tag. The 'id' like the name of the variable in
  the Context. It has also another function, which is however closely
  related. When a tag needs a parent tag - for example a 'field'
  always needs a 'NodeProvider' as a parent - and you don't want to
  refer to the direct parent, but to a parent of the parent, you can
  do this by indicating the id of this parent in an
  attribute. 'NodeReferrer' tags e.g. always can have the attribute
  'node' for this goal. Here we write again the same field as above,
  but it is not nested with two node tags:
  <mm:node id="outernode" referid="typedefnode">
    <mm:node number="1">
       <mm:field node="outernode" name="description" /> 
    </mm:node>
  </mm:node>
</p>
<h2>Creating context variables of lists</h2>
<p>
  What happens if you supply the 'id' attribute to a 'List' tag? Of
  course, if the List tag is a 'NodeProvider' still this id can be
  used in the 'node' attribute of Field tags in the body. But such
  reference does not use the Context.
</p>
<p>
  Before every iteration the value of the current item is written to
  the context, which is removed after every iteration. So inside the
  body of a listnodes tag, with the id of the list you can get a
  'Node' from the context.
</p>
<p>
  When the list is done, then a variable with the type 'List' is
  written to the Context, containing the whole list.  This means that
  also list tags can have the 'referid' attribute, so that you can
  reuse the list. Lets show this.
</p>
<p>A list:
<ul>
<mm:listnodes id="alist" type="typedef" max="5">
  <li><mm:field name="description" /> 
  (<mm:first>showing use of referid in list: </mm:first><mm:node referid="alist"><mm:field name="number" /></mm:node>)
 </li>
</mm:listnodes>
</ul>						  
</p>
<p>Reusing the same list:
<ul>
<mm:listnodes referid="alist">
  <li><mm:field name="description" /></li>
</mm:listnodes>
</ul>
</p>
<p>Making a jspvar of the list. Size of list is: 
<mm:write referid="alist" jspvar="list" vartype="List">
  <%= list.size() %>
</mm:write>
</p>
