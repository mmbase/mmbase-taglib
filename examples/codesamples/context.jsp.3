<mm:context id="A">  
  <mm:import id="hoi">hola!</mm:import>
  In context A we also create the variable 'hoi'. This time its value
 is 'hola!' </p><p>
  <mm:context id="B">
    Within a 'child' context of A (we named it B), you can write easily the variable
    from the parent context:
	<mm:write referid="hoi" /></p><p>
    Imagine that also in this context B we create a variable 'hoi', so
    that now we already have three variable named 'hoi'.
	<mm:import id="hoi">foobar</mm:import>
    <mm:context id="C">
     Then we could also demonstrate the use of the attribute
	'context'. It is not really necessary but exist for symmetry
	reasons. With it you can indicate in which of the parent contexes
	the write tag must be evaluated: <mm:write context="A"
	referid="hoi" />, <mm:write referid="A.hoi" />, <mm:write
	context="B" referid="hoi" />, <mm:write referid="A.B.hoi" />,
	<mm:write referid="hoi" /> </p>
    <p>The most upper value of the
	variable 'hoi' in this page (the one which was gotten with 'haj')
	is not accessible here in context C, because the implicit page
	context is unnamed and the 'hoi' variables of contextes A and B
	are shielding it.
