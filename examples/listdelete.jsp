<h1>List &amp; delete</h1>

<p>
  We demonstrate a simple editor here.
  It allows you to select the nodes from a nodemanager and delete these.
  Note that this example is not optimized, and if a nodemanager contains a lot objects, the system may not be able to handle the request.
  Some objects are protected. You may not be allowed to remove them.
