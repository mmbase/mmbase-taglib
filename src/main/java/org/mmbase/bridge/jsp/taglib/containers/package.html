      Most tags related to 'container' tags are collected here. This includes subtags of container tags. 
    </p>
    <p>
      An important sub-category of container tags are the tags which do provide a Query object of
      which the counterparts (which is contained) are the several NodeList tags). All general tags
      related to generating NodeLists (with Queries) are prefixed with Query.
